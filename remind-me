Remind Me
Set reminders via the cron tool. No scripts, no external dependencies.

Triggers
"Remind me to..."
"Remind me in..."
"Remind me next..."
"Set a reminder for..."
Any scheduling request
One-Time Reminders
Use agentTurn payload with schedule.at (ISO 8601 timestamp). Always delivers to Telegram.

{
  "action": "add",
  "job": {
    "name": "reminder-<slug>",
    "agentId": "main",
    "payload": {
      "kind": "agentTurn",
      "message": "Reminder for User: <context-rich text>. Reply with ONLY the reminder text (2-3 sentences). Do NOT use message tool or exec to send — your reply auto-delivers to Telegram.",
      "model": "haiku",
      "thinking": "off",
      "deliver": true,
      "channel": "telegram",
      "to": "[id goes here]"
    },
    "schedule": {
      "at": "<ISO-8601-with-timezone>"
    },
    "sessionTarget": "isolated",
    "wakeMode": "now",
    "deleteAfterRun": true
  }
}
Rules:

name: reminder-<descriptive-slug> (kebab-case)
sessionTarget: isolated (fires independently)
deleteAfterRun: true (one-shot, clean up after)
Timezone: [fill in]
Channel split: Alerts/reminders → Telegram.
Context rule: Include WHY and surrounding context, not just the bare task. The reminder fires days later — make it useful without memory.
Time Mapping
The agent parses natural language to ISO 8601 directly:

Input	Maps to
"in 2 hours"	now + 2h
"later today"	today 17:00
"tonight"	today 20:00
"tomorrow"	tomorrow 09:00
"tomorrow at 3pm"	tomorrow 15:00
"next Monday"	next Monday 09:00
"next Monday at 2pm"	next Monday 14:00
"January 15"	Jan 15 09:00
"Feb 4 at 10am"	2026-02-04T10:00:00-06:00
Recurring Reminders
Use agentTurn payload with cron schedule expression. Delivers via Telegram.

{
  "action": "add",
  "job": {
    "name": "recurring-<slug>",
    "payload": {
      "kind": "agentTurn",
      "message": "Reminder for User: <text>. Reply with ONLY the reminder text (2-3 sentences). Do NOT use message tool or exec to send — your reply auto-delivers to Telegram.",
      "model": "haiku",
      "thinking": "off",
      "deliver": true,
      "channel": "telegram",
      "to": "id goes here"
    },
    "schedule": {
      "kind": "cron",
      "expr": "<cron-expression>",
      "tz": "tz goes here"
    },
    "sessionTarget": "isolated",
    "wakeMode": "now"
  }
}
Rules:

sessionTarget: isolated (fires independently, delivers to Telegram)
model: haiku (cheap — it's just delivering a message)
Standard 5-field cron: minute hour day month weekday

Managing Reminders
cron list          → see all jobs (reminders are named reminder-* / recurring-*)
cron remove <id>   → delete a reminder
No separate log file. cron list is the source of truth.

Examples
"Remind me to call the dentist tomorrow at 3pm"
→ One-time, schedule.at: "2026-02-02T15:00:00-06:00", text includes "call the dentist"

"Remind me next Wednesday to follow up with Bob about the dev proposal"
→ One-time, next Wednesday 09:00, text includes context about what Bob's proposal was about

"Remind me every Monday at 9am to check Telegram DMs"
→ Recurring, cron 0 9 * * 1, delivers via Telegram

"Remind me in 2 hours to check the builds"
→ One-time, now + 2h, agentTurn to Telegram
